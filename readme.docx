Hope you’re doing well. I’m excited for the third round for the Frontend role at JTG and just wanted to ask if you could kindly give my project a second look.

Last time I got eliminated in this round but I promise I’ve leveled up since then! I’ve put a lot of effort into making it clean, interactive, and responsive, and I’d really love the chance to show my skills properly this time.

Thanks a ton for considering it!!!!
